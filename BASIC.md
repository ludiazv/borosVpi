# Vertical Pi: A versatile mini "motherboard" for raspberry pi and pi-like single-board computers

## Why?
Pis are great but sooner or later users will find troubles:

- Where is power button!!!?? How can I safe shutdown my computer!!!??
- Power issues: Dodgy chargers, usb cables... 
- Temperature control: this is becoming critical for modern Pis.

## Features

- Power your Pi from 8V-24V with simple screw terminal or barrel jack connectors up to 2A (recommended 12V).
- Chainable power for cluster or rack-like mounting.
- Hat/pHat compatible with (no stacking or long headers)
- Vertical mount enable to use large heatsinks and better cooling.
- Tactile power button for safe switch on / off (avoid data loss or SD corruption).
- Auxiliary button for triggering actions in your Pi.
- Dedicated i2c header for connecting mini oled display or 4-pin sensors.
- Control 5V or 12V fan with variable speed and rpm measuring (supports 2-pin, 3-pin and 4-pin fans).
- Control simple piezo-electric buzzer to provide basic audible feedback.
- One custom pin output for control (5V logic level).
- One custom pin output open collector (up to 20V, 150mA)
- Configurable High-level watchdog.
- No Pi GPios are wasted the board require only I2C bus (standard mode and fast mode supported)
- No scripting, no kernel hacks: cli, HTTP REST, MQTT & unix domain sockets.
